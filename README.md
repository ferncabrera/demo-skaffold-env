# A Demo Skaffold Env!
A basic development environment powered by Skaffold (for use as personal reference). Running a multi-service PERN application as the AUT.

Development requirements :
- Docker Desktop (Windows install) v24.0.2
- Kubernetes Clusters on v1.27.2
- Skaffold (Linux install) v2.6.0

After ensuring the above dependecies are installed, clone the repository and cd into the root.

Run skaffold dev - enjoy :D.
